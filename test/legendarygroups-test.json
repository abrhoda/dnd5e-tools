Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a {@dc 14} Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked {@condition prone}.

Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains {@status concentration}, as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image's position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears."
